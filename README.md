# README
This algorithm uses parallel Breadth-first search in order to build layers and a path through these layers. The path is usually the greatest weight path.

The layers are based on semantic closeness. The closer the layers, the closer they are semantically. The path represents the semantically closest path.

This algorithm can be modified for various real-time shortest path searches, modeling trajectories, even more sophisticated data mining processes, and more. The trajectories found can often be interesting and revealing. Accumulations of information around some point are also often interesting and revealing.

Please notice that it can also performs activation in multiple depths.

# Coherence from higher chunking
Text converges towards higher coherence as greater chunk size is selected. Even with a chunk size of two, the text remained very coherent. It was not the case for the chunk size of one. You can change the chunk size in the algorithm settings, and adjust the starting point accordingly.
The algorithm learns from text, adapts to the weights, and performs spreading activation - the spreading activation process from the neurosciences.
Chunking certainly augments coherence.

# Text generation adaptation

If you want to use this for text generation, add a parse tree filter to the algorithm core - only choose tree branches that correspond to the parse tree. Enable randomness if you want more random searches. This is not a chatbot, and if you want to use this algorithm and adapt it to a chatbot, you will have to adapt the algorithm's core to grammatical structure.

# Morphemes

Break the text onto morpheme chunks for more interesting information.

# Waves

Perform Fourrier analysis and break it up onto layers for even more information, down to the neurolinguistic level and neurolinguistic mismatch information. Through analog to digital shifts.
It was wonderful to discover that the waves produced from this hybrid AI / devirgent thought system would resemble electrophysiological signals this much.
Perhaps, consciousness is nothing but an emergent property of specifically ordered and sufficient complex self-oscillating machines, that can be emulated on a computer.

The advances in quantum computing could perhaps shorten the processing speeds, but the Savitch's theorem has already done that to a great extent. Perhaps. I'm not an authority on the subject.

Spreading activation and divergent thought.
